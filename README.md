```
IMPORTANT: 
* I was not able to deploy my application with HEROKU 
* As students, were supposed to recieve credits by connecting with our student profiles in GITHUB. 
* Unforuntatly I never signed up for the 'STUDENT STATUS' through GITHUB. 
* It is taking longer than anticipated to get verified as a student through HEROKU's website. 
* As soon as verification goes through, I will deploy the site and this repository.  
```

## Description :

## Resources :
* **Examples from class assignments**  : <br>
    * This week was a struggle. I started by using a lot of code from **Module-11**. I was able to sort of give my self  a 'map'' of 'TODO's' and started building from there. 
    * I used a few funcitons that didn't seem to work was was getting a lot of syntax erros because of it. 
    * I wasn't able to schedule time with my tutor but I ended up asking BCS lots of questions. I would open a ticket for one problem, they would help me solve, and then open other ticket to solve things like, console erros in my server, syntax errors, unecessary additions to code, eventlistern functions not working. 
    * In the end, ASK BCS was my biggest resource. 

* **ASK BCS** : <br>
when I was confused and running into console erros and deployment erros they were always there to check out my terrible syntax errors
